# Search Pipeline

This is a generated pipeline application built with the Pipeline Framework.

## Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Maven 3.8+

## Verifying the Generated Application

To verify that the application was generated correctly:

```bash
cd Search Pipeline
./mvnw clean verify
```

This will compile all modules, run tests, and verify that there are no syntax or dependency issues.

## Running the Application

### In Development Mode

Use the Quarkus plugin in IntelliJ IDEA or run with:

```bash
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

## Architecture

This application follows the pipeline pattern with multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific step in the processing workflow. Services communicate via gRPC, and the orchestrator coordinates the overall pipeline execution.
