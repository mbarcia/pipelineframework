# Observability Overview

Observability in The Pipeline Framework is designed for distributed pipelines: you should be able to see what each step did, how long it took, and where failures occurred.

## What You Get Out of the Box

1. **Metrics**: Step timings, throughput, and failure counts
2. **Tracing**: End-to-end request visibility across steps
3. **Logging**: Structured logs with correlation identifiers
4. **Health Checks**: Liveness/readiness for orchestration
5. **Alerting**: Dashboards and alert rules tuned for pipeline behavior
6. **Parallelism**: In-flight and buffer depth gauges plus run-level throughput attributes

## Concurrency, Backpressure, and Scalability

Reactive pipelines scale by keeping CPU busy while waiting on I/O. That relies on two levers:

- **Concurrency** (`pipeline.max-concurrency`): how many items a step is allowed to process in parallel.
- **Backpressure buffer capacity** (`pipeline.defaults.backpressure-buffer-capacity`): how many items can be queued
  when upstream is faster than downstream.

These are configured as global defaults but apply **per step**. In other words, every step gets its own concurrency
limit and its own buffer unless you override it per step. This is intentional: each step can have a different I/O
profile and needs separate tuning.

Operationally, you use observability to validate both:
- `tpf.step.inflight` should stay near (but not pinned at) the configured max concurrency for I/O-heavy steps.
- `tpf.step.buffer.queued` should spike during bursts but should not stay flat and high; sustained growth means the
  downstream is too slow or the buffer is too small.

### Retry amplification: what it looks like

When an upstream step is not fully reactive (for example a CSV reader that uses a demand pacer) and a downstream step
talks to a slow third-party, misconfigured pacing can create retry amplification:

- `tpf.step.inflight` on the third-party step grows steadily (for example +1,000 every 5 minutes).
- The input step buffer stays below 80% (it is not the bottleneck anymore).
- Success rate becomes intermittent as retries saturate the downstream.

This is a signal to reduce concurrency on the third-party step, increase retry backoff, and align the pacer with the
true downstream throughput.

### Retry amplification guard

TPF can detect sustained retry amplification and abort a run when configured. The guard evaluates per-step inflight
growth alongside retry rate over a rolling window. When it triggers, the run span records an event with
`tpf.kill_switch.triggered=true` and `tpf.kill_switch.reason=retry_amplification`, and the metric
`tpf.pipeline.kill_switch.triggered` increments.

Use the following metrics to observe the signal:
- `tpf.step.inflight` (in-flight growth)
- `tpf.step.retry.count` (retry attempts per step)

## Dev Mode Behavior (NR vs LGTM)

TPF keeps observability lightweight by default in dev. You opt in to external collectors via env vars.

### New Relic (automatic when `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` is set)

If `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` is present, the runtime config source auto-enables OTel export and disables LGTM.
No application properties changes are required.

Enabled settings (defaults):
- `quarkus.otel.enabled=true`
- `quarkus.otel.traces.enabled=true`
- `quarkus.otel.metrics.enabled=true`
- `quarkus.otel.metric.export.interval=15s` (override with `NEW_RELIC_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` or `QUARKUS_OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL`)
- `quarkus.otel.traces.sampler=parentbased_traceidratio`
- `quarkus.otel.traces.sampler.arg=0.001`
- `quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=${NEW_RELIC_OTLP_ENDPOINT:https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:443}`
- `quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.protocol=http/protobuf`
- `quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.compression=gzip`
- `quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.temporality.preference=delta`
- `quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.headers=api-key=${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY}`
- `quarkus.observability.lgtm.enabled=false`

Usage:
```bash
export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=...
export NEW_RELIC_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.nr-data.net:443
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

### LGTM (explicit opt-in)

LGTM Dev Services are off by default. Enable them explicitly:
```bash
export QUARKUS_OBSERVABILITY_LGTM_ENABLED=true
export QUARKUS_MICROMETER_EXPORT_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

This enables Prometheus metrics for Grafana dashboards and activates the LGTM stack.

Note: when LGTM Dev Services are enabled, Quarkus may override some OTel timing defaults
for dev convenience (for example `quarkus.otel.metric.export.interval=10s`).

### Prometheus/Micrometer Defaults

Templates and example services default to:
```properties
quarkus.micrometer.export.prometheus.enabled=${QUARKUS_MICROMETER_EXPORT_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED:false}
```
so Prometheus/LGTM are opt-in and do not slow down normal dev runs.

## Forcing gRPC Client Spans (Dependencies)

Some pipelines need dependency edges even with low sampling. You can force sampling
of gRPC client spans for selected services:

```properties
pipeline.telemetry.tracing.client-spans.force=true
pipeline.telemetry.tracing.client-spans.allowlist=ProcessCsvPaymentsInputService,ProcessCsvPaymentsOutputFileService
```

When enabled, the orchestrator will always emit client spans for the allowlisted
services (using a sampled parent context) even if the global sampler is low.

## Optional: OTel Java Agent for JVM Runtime UI

New Relic’s JVM Runtime UI expects OpenTelemetry Java agent runtime metrics
(for example `process.runtime.jvm.*`). The Micrometer JVM binder exports `jvm.*`
metrics, which show up in Metrics Explorer but do not fully populate the JVM UI.

If you want the full JVM Runtime page in dev, you can opt in to the OTel Java agent:

```bash
curl -L -o otel-javaagent.jar https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
```

```bash
export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-javaagent:$(pwd)/otel-javaagent.jar"
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=orchestrator-svc
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=${NEW_RELIC_OTLP_ENDPOINT:-https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:443}
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=api-key=${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY}
```

Unset `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` to disable the agent.
