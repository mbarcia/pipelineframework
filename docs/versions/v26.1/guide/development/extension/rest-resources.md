# REST Resource Extensions

Generated REST resources are standard classes. You can extend or wrap them when you need custom REST behavior.

## Typical Extensions

1. Add custom endpoints alongside the generated `/process`
2. Override exception mapping
3. Inject additional services for cross-cutting concerns
