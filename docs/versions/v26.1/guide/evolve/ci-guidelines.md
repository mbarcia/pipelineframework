# Builds and Continuous Integration (CI)

The project uses three independent workflows:

1. **build.yml** — PR/non‑main builds
    - Fast build
    - Unit tests only
    - No Jib, no native, no integration tests

2. **full-tests.yml** — push to `main`
    - Full clean build
    - Jib Docker images
    - Integration tests
    - Native builds (matrix)

3. **publish.yml** — `v*` tags
    - Release build
    - Deploys to Maven Central
    - No tests (already validated in main)
