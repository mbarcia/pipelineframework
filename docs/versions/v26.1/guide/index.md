# Introduction

The Pipeline Framework is a powerful tool for building reactive pipeline processing systems. It simplifies the development of distributed systems by providing a consistent way to create, configure, and deploy pipeline steps.

<Callout type="tip" title="Visual Pipeline Designer">
The Pipeline Framework includes a visual canvas designer at <a href="https://app.pipelineframework.org" target="_blank">https://app.pipelineframework.org</a> that allows you to create and configure your pipelines using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Simply design your pipeline visually, click "Download Application", and you'll get a complete ZIP file with all the generated source code - no command-line tools needed!
</Callout>

## Key Features

- **Reactive Programming**: Built on top of Mutiny for non-blocking operations
- **Immutable Architecture (by default)**: Persistence is append-first and configurable; updates are explicit and opt-in
- **Visual Design Canvas**: Create and configure pipelines with the visual designer at [https://app.pipelineframework.org](https://app.pipelineframework.org)
- **Annotation-Based Configuration**: Simplifies adapter generation with `@PipelineStep`
- **gRPC & REST Flexibility**: Automatic adapter generation for fast gRPC or easy REST integration
- **Multiple Processing Patterns**: OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany, SideEffect and blocking variants
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health check capabilities
- **Multiple Persistence Models**: Choose from reactive or virtual thread-based persistence
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between runtime and deployment components
- **Test Integration**: Built-in support for unit and integration tests with Testcontainers

## Framework Overview

For complete documentation of the framework architecture, implementation details, and reference implementations, see the complete documentation files in the main repository:

- [Reference Implementation](/versions/v26.1/guide/evolve/reference-implementation) - Complete implementation guide with examples
- [Canvas Designer Guide](/versions/v26.1/guide/getting-started/canvas-guide) - Complete Canvas usage guide
- [Java-Centered Types](/versions/v26.1/guide/development/java-centered-types) - Comprehensive Java-first approach with automatic protobuf mapping

## How It Works

The framework lets you define pipeline steps as simple classes annotated with `@PipelineStep`. At build time, it generates the adapters and infrastructure, keeping services clean and focused on business logic.
