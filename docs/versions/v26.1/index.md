<Callout type="tip" title="Visual Pipeline Designer Available">
The Pipeline Framework includes a visual canvas designer at <a href="https://app.pipelineframework.org" target="_blank">https://app.pipelineframework.org</a> that allows you to create and configure your pipelines using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Simply design your pipeline visually, click "Download Application", and you'll get a complete ZIP file with all the generated source code - no command-line tools needed!
</Callout>

## Introduction

The Pipeline Framework is a powerful tool for building reactive pipeline processing systems. It simplifies the development of distributed systems by providing a consistent way to create, configure, and deploy pipeline steps.

## Key Features

- **Reactive Programming**: Built on top of Mutiny for non-blocking operations
- **Immutable Architecture**: No database updates during pipeline execution - only appends/preserves, ensuring data integrity
- **Annotation-Based Configuration**: Simplifies adapter generation with `@PipelineStep`
- **gRPC & REST Flexibility**: Automatic adapter generation for fast gRPC or easy REST integration
- **Multiple Processing Patterns**: OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany, SideEffect and blocking variants
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health check capabilities
- **Multiple Persistence Models**: Choose from reactive or virtual thread-based persistence
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between runtime and deployment components
- **Auto-Generation**: Generates necessary infrastructure at build time
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics, tracing, and logging support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with DLQ support
- **Backpressure Management**: Reactive processing with configurable backpressure strategies
