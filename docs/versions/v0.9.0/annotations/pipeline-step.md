# Annotations

The Pipeline Framework uses annotations to simplify configuration and automatic generation of pipeline components.

## @PipelineStep

The `@PipelineStep` annotation marks a class as a pipeline step and enables automatic generation of gRPC and REST adapters.

### Parameters

- `inputType`: The input type for this step (domain type)
- `outputType`: The output type for this step (domain type)
- `stepType`: The step type (StepOneToOne, StepOneToMany, etc.)
- `backendType`: The backend adapter type (GenericGrpcReactiveServiceAdapter, etc.)
- `inboundMapper`: The inbound mapper class for this pipeline service/step - handles conversion from gRPC to domain types (using MapStruct-based unified Mapper interface)
- `outboundMapper`: The outbound mapper class for this pipeline service/step - handles conversion from domain to gRPC types (using MapStruct-based unified Mapper interface)
- `grpcEnabled`: Whether to enable gRPC adapter generation for this step
- `local`: Whether this step runs locally in the same process (default: false). When `true`, the step runs in the same application process without requiring gRPC communication, making it suitable for services that process data locally within the orchestrator.
- `restEnabled`: Whether to enable REST adapter generation for this step
- `runOnVirtualThreads`: Whether to offload server processing to virtual threads.

### Example

```java
@PipelineStep(
   inputType = PaymentRecord.class,
   outputType = PaymentStatus.class,
   stepType = StepOneToOne.class,
   backendType = GenericGrpcReactiveServiceAdapter.class,
   inboundMapper = PaymentRecordMapper.class,
   outboundMapper = PaymentStatusMapper.class,
   grpcEnabled = true,
   restEnabled = false,
   runOnVirtualThreads = true,
)
@ApplicationScoped
public class ProcessPaymentService implements StepOneToOne<PaymentRecord, PaymentStatus> {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Understanding parallel vs runOnVirtualThreads

It's important to understand the difference between these two configuration options:

- **`parallel`**: For client-side steps, enables concurrent processing of multiple items from the same stream. This translates into a flatMap() call (when parallel=true) or a concatMap() call (when parallel=false)
- **`runOnVirtualThreads`**: For server-side gRPC services, enables execution of `process()` code on virtual threads for better I/O handling

## Usage

Developers only need to:

1. Annotate their service class with `@PipelineStep`
2. Create MapStruct-based mapper interfaces that extend the `Mapper<Grpc, Dto, Domain>` interface
3. Implement the service interface (`StepOneToOne`, etc.)

The framework automatically generates and registers the adapter beans at build time.
